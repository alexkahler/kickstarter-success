There are some general questions that you should think about, and answer during the project. If you can - try and answer them now, but otherwise it is a good starting point for the first supervision meeting.

    Objective // hypothesis
        What is the question that you are trying to answer?
        What has been done previously - quick literature search.
    Data
        What number of observations do you have?
        What kind of features are available? (high level description)
        How many features
    Model information
        What is the model input
        What is the model output
        What loss function will you use?
    Evaluation
        Metric - what measure is it that you care about?
        What can you compare your algorithm with? E.g. a na√Øve guess, a simple model, or results from literature
